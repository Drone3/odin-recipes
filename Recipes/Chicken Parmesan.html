    <H2>Description</H2>
    <p> 
        Chicken Parmesan, often called Chicken Parmigiana, is a beloved Italian-American dish that features breaded chicken cutlets topped with marinara sauce and melted cheese. This hearty meal combines the rich flavors of Italian cuisine with a comforting, homey appeal. The chicken cutlets are first coated in a mixture of breadcrumbs and grated Parmesan cheese, then fried until golden and crispy. They are then layered with marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese before being baked to perfection. The result is a dish that boasts a satisfying crunch on the outside while remaining tender and juicy on the inside, with a luscious, cheesy topping that melts into the tangy tomato sauce.</p>
        
    </p> Originating from the classic Italian dish Melanzane alla Parmigiana, which uses eggplant instead of chicken, Chicken Parmesan has become a staple in Italian-American kitchens and restaurants. It’s commonly served with pasta, often spaghetti or fettuccine, and garnished with fresh basil or parsley for an extra touch of flavor. This dish not only captures the essence of Italian comfort food but also showcases the adaptability of traditional recipes to new ingredients and tastes. Whether enjoyed as a family dinner, a hearty lunch, or a crowd-pleasing party dish, Chicken Parmesan remains a favorite for its delicious blend of textures and flavors.</p>
