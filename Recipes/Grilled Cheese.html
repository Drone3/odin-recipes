    </p> Combine the butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Make the sandwiches with two slices of bacon and one slice of cheddar cheese. Spread the butter mixture on each slice of bread. Cook in a skillet until golden brown on both sides.</p>

    <li>4 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>8 slices sourdough bread</li>
         
        </ul>
<ol>
<li>Mash together butter and Parmesan cheese in a small bowl until evenly blended.</li>
