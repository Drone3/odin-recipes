    <H2>Description</H2>
    <p> Shawarma chicken is a popular Middle Eastern dish known for its flavorful and aromatic profile. The chicken is marinated in a mixture of spices including cumin, turmeric, paprika, and garlic, then cooked slowly on a vertical rotisserie. This cooking method ensures that the meat remains tender and juicy while developing a slightly crispy exterior. Once cooked, the chicken is thinly sliced and typically served in a warm pita or flatbread, accompanied by fresh vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions, and drizzled with tahini or garlic sauce.</p>
